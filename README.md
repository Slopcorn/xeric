This project explores some ways to use heuristic search to find optimal solutions for polynomials. Then attempts to apply them to machine learning models are made to find which one will take the least time to get a decent result.

The folder *clean* contains python notebooks that have not been run. The folder *executed* contains python notebooks that have (which I will only upload once I feel I've done enough here).
